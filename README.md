Stretch 
Social media sites are designed to have a suite of unique and engaging features that enrich the site. When we started, we wanted to incorporate features like
1. A like button that would update features in MongoDB
2. A share button that would, at the very least, send an email with the link of the user's profile to an inputted email
3. A follow feature and "following" tab that would let you quickly see all the content from your followed accounts
4. Tags that would be attached to all images to allow themed searches
5. Deeper incorporation of the Unsplash API in elements like filling fake user's accounts with photos

Given more time, we feel like these features (and more) would be easily achievable, but given the one-week time frame and, frankly, our limited experience building full-stack applications, we were not able to accomplish them.
